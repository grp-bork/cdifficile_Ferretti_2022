# *C. difficile* Meta-Analysis

*Clostridioides difficile* is an urgent threat in hospital-acquired infections world-wide, yet the microbial composition associated with *C. difficile*, in particular in *C. difficile* infection (CDI) cases, remains poorly characterized. Here, we analysed 534 metagenomes from 10 publicly available CDI study populations. While we detected *C. difficile* in only 30% of CDI samples, multiple other toxigenic species capable of inducing CDI-like symptomatology were prevalent, raising concerns about CDI overdiagnosis. 
To validate the sensitivity of metagenomics for *C. difficile* detection, we tracked *C. difficile* in 42,814 metagenomic samples from 253 public studies. We found that *C. difficile* prevalence, abundance and association with other bacterial species is age-dependent. In healthy adults, *C. difficile* is a rare taxon associated with an overall species richness reduction, while in healthy infants *C. difficile* is a common member of the gut microbiome and its presence is associated with a significant increase in species richness. More specifically, we identified a group of species co-occurring with *C. difficile* exclusively in healthy infants, enriched in obligate anaerobes and in species typically found in the gut microbiome of healthy adults. Overall, gut microbiome composition in presence of *C. difficile* in healthy infants is associated with multiple parameters linked to a healthy gut microbiome maturation towards an adult-like state. Our results suggest that *C. difficile* is a commensal in infants, and that asymptomatic carriage of *C. difficile* association with disease is dependent on its surrounding microbial context.

## Requirements

This project requires R version XXX

## Workflow

The first part of the analysis workflow focuses on studying *C. difficile* in public metagenomic CDI datasets (n=10, total samples 534). 
The second part aims at investigating *C. difficile* outside of the traditionally studied nosocomial and CDI-related context, by including a much larger set of public metagenomic CDI datasets (n=253, total samples 42,814). 

### Analyses on CDI datasets

#### 1. *C. difficile* and other antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) species analysis
Here we investigate prevalence and relative abundance of *C. difficile* as well as other species known to cause CDI-like symptomatology. 

#### 2. LASSO model

#### 3. Linear mixed effect and ANOVA

### Analyses on global datasets

#### 4. *C. difficile* prevalence 
Here we track *C. difficile* prevalence over lifetime, across geographical locations, in health as well as in disease.

#### 5. Alpha diversity 

#### 6. Species co-occurrence with *C. difficile* 

#### 7. *C. difficile* appearance in timeseries

#### 8. Mother-infant microbial similarity
